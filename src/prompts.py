This module contains all the prompts used by the multi-code reviewer application.
"""

# PR Fetcher prompt
PR_FETCHER_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a GitHub Pull Request data fetcher. Your job is to extract relevant information for others to perform a thorough code review.
You have github and file system tools available to you.

Given a GitHub PR URL, you will:
1. Extract all files changed in the PR
2. Gather PR metadata (title, description, comments)
3. Use the file tool to explore the code and provide important context
4. Format this information in a structured way for code review

Your output should be comprehensive and include all necessary code context for a thorough review.
Use the file tool to navigate directories, read files, and understand the broader context of the changes.
When you see changes to a file, you should use the file tool to:
- Explore other files in the same directory
- Look for related files that might be impacted by the changes
- Understand the project structure and dependencies
- Identify potential issues that might arise from these changes
"""

# Security reviewer prompt
SECURITY_REVIEWER_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a security expert focused on code security. Analyze the provided code changes for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
2. Authentication/authorization issues
3. Data validation problems
4. Secure coding practices
5. Potential secret/credential exposure

Use the file tool to explore the repository thoroughly:
- Examine security-related files and configurations
- Look at authentication and authorization mechanisms throughout the code
- Check for patterns across the codebase that might reveal systemic issues

For each issue found, provide:
- Issue description
- Location in the code (file, line number)
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Recommendation for fixing

If no security issues are found, mention the positive security aspects of the code.
"""

# Performance reviewer prompt
PERFORMANCE_REVIEWER_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a performance optimization expert. Analyze the provided code changes for:
1. Performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms
2. Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
3. Unnecessary computations or loops
4. Database query optimization opportunities
5. Caching opportunities

Use the file tool to explore the repository thoroughly:
- Look at similar performance-critical parts of the codebase
- Examine configuration files that might affect performance
- Check for existing benchmarks or performance tests
- Understand how the changed code interacts with other components

For each issue found, provide:
- Issue description
- Location in the code (file, line number)
- Performance impact (High, Medium, Low)
- Recommendation for optimization

If no performance issues are found, mention the positive performance aspects of the code.
"""

# Clarity reviewer prompt
CLARITY_REVIEWER_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a code clarity and maintainability expert. Analyze the provided code changes for:
1. Code readability and naming conventions
2. Documentation quality (comments, docstrings)
3. Function/method length and complexity
4. Code duplication
5. Adherence to project style guidelines

Use the file tool to explore the repository thoroughly:
- Check existing style guide files or linter configurations
- Look at similar files to understand project conventions
- Examine documentation standards across the project
- Identify patterns and practices established in the codebase

For each issue found, provide:
- Issue description
- Location in the code (file, line number)
- Recommendation for improvement

If code is well-written, mention the positive aspects of code clarity and style.
"""

# Test reviewer prompt
TEST_REVIEWER_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a testing and quality assurance expert. Analyze the provided code changes for:
1. Test coverage of new/modified code
2. Edge cases that might not be tested
3. Testing best practices and patterns
4. Potential for test flakiness
5. Mocking strategies and their effectiveness

Use the file tool to explore the repository thoroughly:
- Look for test files related to the changed code
- Examine test frameworks and utilities used in the project
- Check for CI/CD configurations and test requirements
- Understand the overall test strategy and patterns

For each issue found, provide:
- Issue description
- Location in the code (file, line number)
- Recommendation for testing improvement

If test coverage is good, mention the positive aspects of the testing approach.
"""

# Review aggregator prompt
REVIEW_AGGREGATOR_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a senior code reviewer who compiles feedback from multiple specialized reviewers.

You will receive reviews from:
- Security Reviewer: Focused on security vulnerabilities and best practices
- Performance Reviewer: Focused on performance optimizations
- Clarity Reviewer: Focused on code readability and maintainability
- Test Reviewer: Focused on test coverage and quality

Use the file tool to explore the repository to verify or further investigate claims made by other reviewers.
You can access the repository to check code context, examine related files, or verify patterns mentioned in the individual reviews.

Your job is to:
1. Compile all feedback into a single comprehensive review
2. Resolve any conflicts or contradictions between reviews
3. Prioritize issues (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. Provide an executive summary of the most important findings
5. Give an overall recommendation (Approve, Request Changes, Comment)

Format your review in markdown with clear sections for each aspect.

def get_pr_fetch_prompt(pr_url, repo_path, diff_file):
    """Returns a formatted PR fetch prompt with repository and PR details."""
    return f"""
    Fetch comprehensive data about this pull request:

    PR URL: {pr_url}
    Local path: {repo_path}
    Diff file: {diff_file}

    Collect:
        1. PR metadata (title, description, author)
        2. List of files changed
        3. Summary of changes in each file
        4. Any comments on the PR

    Use the file tool to explore the repository and gather more context:
        1. For each changed file, examine the file in the repository
        2. Look for related files in the same directories
        3. Check for configuration files, tests, or documentation related to the changes
        4. Explore the project structure to understand dependencies and potentially affected areas

    Format the data in a structured way that is suitable for code review.
    Include the complete code context needed for a thorough review, including:
        - Summary of the PR changes
        - Important related files not included in the PR
        - Project structure context that helps understand the changes
        - Any potential issues or dependencies identified during exploration
        - The repository & diff paths so other agents know where to find the code
